								<h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
								<p>
								At Rainbow, we strongly believe that our people are critical to our success in building a sustainable and dominant business 
								in the countries we operate in across Africa and beyond. We go to great ends to source, attract, recruit, develop and 
								retain the best talents where-ever they may be in the world. To this end, we are always striving to:

								Recruit, develop and retain a highly talented workforce
								Provide a non-threatening environment that encourages and rewards role-model performance
								Help our work-force maintain a healthy balance between work and their personal lives
								Provide competitive compensation and benefits that rank amongst the top-tier competitors in each of the countries we operate in
								Ensure adequate avenue for career growth and exploration – whether functional or across country lines
								Develop a culturally diverse pool of talented professionals with the skills and mind-set to deliver excellent results across 
								different markets and cultures across the African continent and beyond
								Rainbow Academy

								We understand that the only way to get the best results and continually stay ahead of the curve is to continually sharpen our most 
								important asset – our people. In commitment to this, in 2008, we set up the Rainbow Academy as a force to reckon with in continually 
								training and developing our workforce, so they can continue to be at the fore-front of best-breed professionals in the world.

								Our dedicated Learning and Development professionals are always on top of closing any detected competency gap in our work-force. Rainbow Academy 
								adopts a mix of different learning methods ranging from e-learning programmes, class-room trainings to off-site trainings both locally and abroad.
								 The Academy also issues a certificate upon successful completion of its modules and has successfully graduated 
								 4 batches of Management Trainees from its rigorous trainee programme.</p>

								<h3>Performance Management</h3>
								<p>
								Rainbow Bank runs a robust goal-driven Performance Management System which measures each employee’s
								 performance against care-fully defined targets, their level of team-work and the organization’s performance.
								 We strive to ensure that every employee understands how he contributes to the organization’s bottom-line. 
								 Asides measuring performance, our performance management system seeks to reward Role Model performance 
								 accordingly while at the same time, helping least performing Staff to get better on the job.</p>

								<h3>Compensation and Rewards</h3>
								<p>
								Rainbow Bank strives to be among the top-tier industry competitor in terms of compensation, 
								in each country it operates in. We understand the powerful impact of rewards can have in

								Rainbow Bank Graduate trainee programme aims to inspire participants to discover the next stage of their lives after graduation.
								 The mission is to facilitate new understanding and life-changing learning. Through our engaging classroom environment
								, participants will learn from industry experts, and cultivate a master’s level business mind.
